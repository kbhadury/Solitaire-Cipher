# Solitaire-Cipher

The [Solitaire cipher](http://aarontoponce.org/wiki/card-ciphers/solitaire) is an encryption scheme devised by Bruce Schneier which relies only on a pack of cards for encryption and decryption.  The idea is that secret agents are less likely to be placed under suspicion for carrying a deck of cards than if they're hiding the Enigma machine under their shirt.  The encryption and decryption algorithms are fairly straightforward; however, the system is rather slow, so I wrote a script in Python to simulate decryption given a starting deck.  

This algorithm is used in [Puzzle 4](http://cyberdefense.anl.gov/2017/02/01/puzzle-4-achevare/) of the Argonne National Laboratory's 2017 Cyber Defense Competition, so I won't release the code until the solutions have been published.  Good luck to everyone competing!

_Update 3/10/17_: the solutions are up!  Check out the Python code.
